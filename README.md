Subset Godot DDA(Data Driven Architecture) was created with ideas from Game Archirecture with Scriptable Objects from Unite Austin 2017

https://github.com/roboryantron/Unite2017

For Godat implementations, use Resource objects instead of Scriptable Objects.

And I Referenced the [Unity Atoms](https://github.com/unity-atoms/unity-atoms) project.
